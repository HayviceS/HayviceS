## About me 
I am a year 11 student based in Auckland. I have a family of six, 2 parents, 2 sisters, and a twin. In my free time I tend to bake, read, work out, or hang out with friends. I am quite a social person however I do enjoy my time alone and I am very indepentent. 

#### Past projects
In the past I have worked on a few different things such as:
+ 3D Objects
+ A Music Website
+ Profile Card

### Why do I do digital technology?
I take digi tech because I like to solve problems. During class for me it is fun to put in my headphones and get right into my work. I find it satisfying to see what I have made from scratch and the progress I have made along the way.

##### Websites I use
+ Scratch
+ Visual code studio
+ Blender
+ GitHub
+ Ultimaker Cura
